# Image Classification with Custom CNN

This project implements an image classification system using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of American Sign Language (ASL) gestures into 26 classes (A-Z). The model is trained on a dataset of ASL signs, and the trained model is deployed using Streamlit for real-time predictions.

## Features

- **Image Classification:** Upload an image of an ASL gesture, and the model predicts the corresponding letter.
- **Custom CNN Architecture:** A deep learning model built using PyTorch to recognize ASL signs.
- **Streamlit Interface:** An interactive web app where users can upload images and get predictions.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following Python packages installed:

- `torch==2.5.1`
- `torchvision==0.20.1`
- `streamlit==1.40.1`
- `matplotlib==3.8.3`
- `seaborn==0.13.2`
- `scikit-learn==1.4.1.post1`
- `Pillow==10.3.0`
- `gdown==5.2.0`
